Dotfiles
========

These are my personal configuration files. Having them in a GitHub repository
allows me to instantly set up shop on any machine as well as keep my tools and
configurations in sync across my laptop and desktop machines.

Workflow
--------

For the curious, here is a list of the tools (toolchain) I am currently using.
It is heavily keyboard and command-line centric.

- __OS:__ OSX on my laptop and Ubuntu on my various servers. These dotfiles
  work on both.
- __Terminal:__ [Hyper] a terminal written in JS/HTML/CSS.
- __Text editor:__ [Vim] may have a steep learning curve, but for me the
  return on investment was nearly immediate. For anyone looking to make the
  leap, I recommend reading [Coming Home to Vim] a blog post by Steve Losh
  and [Your problem with Vim is that you don't grock vi] by StackOverflow user
  Jim Dennis.
    - __Colorscheme:__ [Molokai] a high contrast, dark background colorscheme.
    - __Code Linting:__ [Syntastic] Find mal-formatted code at save time instead of
    at run time.
    - __Undo:__ [Gundo] View and move through undo history as a tree.
    - __Status Line:__ [Vim Airline] Beautiful status line with all the info
    I need, implemented in native VimL.
    - __File Opener:__ [ctrl-p] Fuzzy matching file opener.
- __Version control:__ [Git] I interact with Git via the command line.
